"[45] [Overall accuracy] | Estimated data by the water balance model used in the 2012 Agricultural water use exercise. Canada Statistics declare 0.838 (2010), but the resulting water requirement ratio was incoherent (304%). This is certainly due to the model using the long-term average precipitations and assuming that crop optimal growth. So estimated value is a maximum value especially if precipitations are higher than the average (supplemental irrigation only)."
